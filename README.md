A devoted backend developer with three years of experience developing web-based SaaS applications. I thrive in competitive team environments and bring creativity and rational problem-solving skills to high-pressure situations. I am excited to work with forward-thinking innovators in web development and SaaS solutions.

I am currently learning Solidity for Smart Contracts and honing my CSS skills to complement my backend knowledge and achieve full-stack developer mastery.
